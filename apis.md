description: Repose is an open-source platform that you can use to build stacks of
  reusable software components. These components can be leveraged by service developers
  to perform common API processing tasks. By using Reposes components rather than
  creating their own, service developers can focus on the unique features of their
  services. Repose can be used inside a service to perform API operations. It can
  also run on one or more separate servers as a proxy to one or more services. At
  its core, Repose is a proxy that allows services to use Enterprise Integration Patterns
  (EIP).
